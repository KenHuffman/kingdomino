kingdomino
==========

This program is a react.js based implementation of the Kingdomino game.
I'm implementing it to learn react.js.

It is built as a jar that has an embedded jetty server.

After a "mvn install", it can be run with "java -jar kingdomino-XXX.jar" then
you can point your browser to "http://localhost:8080".

I believe the backend functionality is near complete, but the front end is
very rough.
