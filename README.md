kingdomino
==========

This program is a react.js based implementation of the Kingdomino game.
I'm implementing it to learn react.js. It is built as a war,
but it can be executed as a standalone spring boot application.

I believe the backend functionality is near complete, but the front end needs
some css adjustment to display things prettier.
